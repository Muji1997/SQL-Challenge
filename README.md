# SQL Challenge - Pewlett Hackard Employee Database
## Overview

As a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, your primary task is to conduct a research project about employees who worked at the company during the 1980s and 1990s. This project involves:

- Data Modeling: Creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) or table schemas for the database.
- Data Engineering: Designing and creating the database tables, including defining data types, keys, and relationships. Importing data from CSV files into these tables.
- Data Analysis: Answering specific questions about the employee data using SQL queries.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **ERD**: This directory contains the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) or table schemas for the database tables. You can find the schema design in the `schema.png` file.

- **SQL**: This directory contains the SQL script used to create the database schema and perform data analysis. The script is named `pewlett_hackard.sql`.

- **Data**: This directory holds the CSV files with the employee data used in the project.

- **README.md**: The README file provides an overview of the project, instructions, and details about the SQL queries used for data analysis.

## Data Analysis

The SQL queries in the `pewlett_hackard.sql` script address various data analysis tasks, including:

- Listing employee details such as employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
- Identifying employees hired in 1986.
- Listing department managers with department information.
- Associating each employee with their department.
- Finding specific employees by name and department.
- Analyzing the frequency of employee last names.

These queries provide insights into the Pewlett Hackard Employee Database.
